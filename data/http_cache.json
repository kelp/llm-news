    "content_cache": "This week, the California Governor\u2019sWorking Group on AI Frontier Modelsreleased its draft report. We agree with the working group\u2019s focus on the need forobjective standardsand evidence-based policy guidance, and especially its emphasis on transparency as a means to create a well functioning AI policy environment.When done thoughtfully, transparency can be a low-cost, high-impact means of growing the evidence base around a new technology, increasing consumer trust, and causing companies to enter into positive-sum competitions with one another. We welcome greater discussion of how frontier labs should be transparent about their AI development practices and were glad to see the working group emphasize this - in particular, we appreciated the focus on the need for labs to disclose how they secure their models from theft, and how they test their models for potential national security risks.Many of the report\u2019s recommendations already reflect industry best practices which Anthropic adheres to: for example Anthropic\u2019sResponsible Scaling Policypublicly lays out how we assess our models for misuse and autonomy risks and thresholds that trigger increased safety and security measures for us. We also publicly describe the results of our safety and security testing as part of each major model release, and performthird-party testingto augment our own internal tests. Many other frontier AI companies have similar practices.In line with the report\u2019s findings, we believe governments could play a constructive role in improving transparency in the safety and security practices of frontier AI companies. At present frontier AI companies are notrequiredto have a safety and security policy (even one entirely of their choice), nor to describe it publicly, nor to publicly document the tests they run \u2013 and therefore not all companies do. We believe this could be done in alight-touch waythat does not impede innovation. As we wrote in ourrecent policy submission to the White House, we believe powerful AI systems will arrive soon - perhaps as early as the end of 2026 - so it is important we all devote effort to building a policy regime that creates greater transparency about the safety and security protocols of how AI systems are built.The Working Group has also highlighted areas where academia, civil society, and industry will need to apply more focus in the coming years - particularly on the economic impacts of AI, where Anthropic is today trying to contribute viaour Economic Index. We look forward to providing further feedback to the working group to aid and inform the work of finalizing the report. We commend the Governor for his foresight in kicking off this conversation, and we look forward to helping shape California\u2019s approach to frontier model safety."

The most important thing to understand about AI is how quickly it is moving. A few years ago, AI systems could barely string together a coherent sentence. Today they can pass medical exams, write poetry, and tell jokes. This rapid progress is ultimately driven by the amount of available computation, which is growing by 8x per year and is unlikely to slow down in the next few years. Thegeneraltrend of rapid improvement is predictable, however, it is actually very difficult to predict when AI will acquirespecificskills or knowledge. This unfortunately includes dangerous skills, such as the ability to construct biological weapons1. We are thus facing a number of potential AI-related threats which, although relatively limited given today\u2019s systems, are likely to become very serious at some unknown point in the near future. This is very different from most other industries: imagine if each new model of car had some chance of spontaneously sprouting a new (and dangerous) power, like the ability to fire a rocket boost or accelerate to supersonic speeds.We need both a way to frequently monitor these emerging risks, and a protocol for responding appropriately when they occur. Responsible scaling policies\u2014initially suggested by the Alignment Research Center\u2014attempt to meet this need. Anthropic published its RSP in September, and was the first major AI company to do so. It has two major components:"

What \u201cvalues\u201d might a language model have?These are all questions people grapple with. Our recently published research on \u201cConstitutional AI\u201d provides one answer by giving language models explicit values determined by a constitution, rather than values determined implicitly via large-scale human feedback. This isn\u2019t a perfect approach, but it does make the values of the AI system easier to understand and easier to adjust as needed.Since launchingClaude, our AI assistant trained with Constitutional AI, we've heard more questions about Constitutional AI and how it contributes to making Claude safer and more helpful. In this post, we explain what constitutional AI is, what the values in Claude\u2019s constitution are, and how we chose them.If you just want to skip to the principles, scroll down to the last section which is entitled \u201cThe Principles in Full.\u201d"

    "content_cache": "We believe that sensible artificial intelligence (AI) policy requires, among other things, the ability to accurately describe and quantify the capabilities and risks of AI systems. This ability is both an enabler and a prerequisite to effective regulation, as measurement tools allow us to objectively assess systems and ensure they meet appropriate safety thresholds. In this post, we propose a policy intervention for how to do this: ambitiously fund the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to support its AI measurement and standards efforts.We were heartened by the bipartisan support for maintaining American leadership in the development of critical technologies, as expressed during the April 18budget hearingon the 2024 Request for the Department of Commerce (and by extension, NIST). We think one of the best ways to channel that support is through an increase in federal funding for NIST so that it is well placed to carry out its work promoting safe technological innovation.In this post, we give an overview of why we think this, and we also share a policy proposal for what an ambitious funding program for NIST could look like in practice. This proposal is readily actionable and builds on a solid foundation of existing work at the agency; we view it as a complement to a suite of policy levers for stronger AI governance."

The financing will help Anthropic build large-scale experimental infrastructure to explore and improve the safety properties of computationally intensive AI models.Since its founding at the beginning of 2021, Anthropic has conducted research into making systems that are more steerable, robust, and interpretable. On interpretability, it has made progress in mathematicallyreverse engineering the behavior of small language modelsand begun to understand the source ofpattern-matching behavior in large language models. On steerability and robustness, it has developedbaseline techniques to make large language models more \u201chelpful and harmless\u201d, and followed this up withreinforcement learning to further improve these properties, as well as releasing a dataset to help other research labs train models that are morealigned with human preferences. It has also released an analysis ofsudden changes in performance in large language models and the societal impacts of this phenomenon, which demonstrates the need for studying safety issues at scale.The purpose of this research is to develop the technical components necessary to build large-scale models which have better implicit safeguards and require less after-training interventions, as well as to develop the tools necessary to further look inside these models to be confident that the safeguards actually work. The company is also building out teams and partnerships dedicated to exploring the policy and societal impacts of these models.\u201cWith this fundraise, we\u2019re going to explore the predictable scaling properties of machine learning systems, while closely examining the unpredictable ways in which capabilities and safety issues can emerge at-scale,\u201d said Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei. \u201cWe\u2019ve made strong initial progress on understanding and steering the behavior of AI systems, and are gradually assembling the pieces needed to make usable, integrated AI systems that benefit society.\u201dAnthropic is now a growing team of around 40 people based in a plant-filled office in San Francisco, California, with plans to expand further this year. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve built out the organization, we\u2019re focusing on ensuring Anthropic has the culture and governance to continue to responsibly explore and develop safe AI systems as we scale,\u201d said Anthropic co-founder and President Daniela Amodei. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about what\u2019s ahead, and grateful to all be working together.\u201dThe Series B follows the company raising $124 million in a Series A round in 2021. The Series B round was led by Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX. The round also included participation from Caroline Ellison, Jim McClave, Nishad Singh, Jaan Tallinn, and the Center for Emerging Risk Research (CERR)."
